Description: Implements linear regression analysis using QR decomposition for enhanced
    numerical stability and computational efficiency. Provides comprehensive
    methods for model fitting, diagnostics, and visualization including
    coefficient estimates, standard errors, residuals, fitted values, and
    diagnostic plots. The package follows standard R conventions with methods
    for print, summary, plot, coef, resid, and vcov. Includes detailed
    vignettes with step-by-step tutorials, practical examples, and
    comparative analyses demonstrating the advantages of QR decomposition
    over traditional linear regression approaches.
